# Projects
## Electronics Lead, Red Dragons Robot Soccer
[Red Dragons Robot Soccer](https://www.linkedin.com/company/red-dragons-ufscar/) is a student organization competing in the IEEE Very Small Size Soccer I have been involved since 2018, and have been the electronics lead since 2020, being responsable for the development of the robot's electronics systems, including hardware design and firmware.
For the VSSS category,  each team has either 3 or 5 autonomous 10x10cm robots with different roles, with the objective of pushing the ball to the opposite goal. Altough it seems simple, computer vision systems and control algorithms must be implemented so that the robots know where they are in relation to the field, where the ball is and what actions must be taken to sucessfully socre a goal, without violating the rules.
### 2018
I joined the team in 2018, at which point homemade, heat transfer PCBs were still being used. That was only possible because of the low complexity of the electronics systems, that included a PIC18 microncotroller, a XBEE serial radio, motor driver and voltage regulators. To improve the boards' complexity, stacked homemade PCBs proved unreliable, so we had to think about either upgrading our manufactoring techniques, or remaining with low complexity hardware.
